# from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem
The **Gödel completeness theorem** says that 
for any first-order theory T with a *well-orderable* language, and any *sentence* s in the language of T,

if T ⊧ s, then T ⊦ s.

Since the converse (soundness) also holds, it follows that T ⊧ s iff T ⊦ s.
