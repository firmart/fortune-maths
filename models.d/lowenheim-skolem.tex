The \textbf{Löwenheim–Skolem theorem} states that for every signature $\sigma$, 
every infinite $\sigma$-structure $M$ and every infinite cardinal number $\kappa \ge |\sigma|$, 
there is a $\sigma$-structure $N$ such that $|N| = \kappa$ and

- if $\kappa < |M|$ then $N$ is an elementary substructure of $M$;
- if $\kappa > |M|$ then $N$ is an elementary extension of $M$.
