# from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem
The **Löwenheim–Skolem theorem** states that for every signature σ, 
every infinite σ-structure M and every infinite cardinal number κ ≥ |σ|, 
there is a σ-structure N such that |N| = κ and

- if κ < |M| then N is an elementary substructure of M;
- if κ > |M| then N is an elementary extension of M.
